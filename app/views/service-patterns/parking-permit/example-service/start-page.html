  <h1 class="heading-xlarge">Apply for a resident's parking permit in {{council.shortName}}</h1>

  <p>
    To park in {{council.parkingBoundary}}, you'll need a resident's parking permit.
  </p>
  <p>
    Parking permits allow you to park anywhere within the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2009/nov/03/google">boundaries of the city</a>.
  </p>

        You won't receive a physical permit. Wardens will check your vehicle's registration number.
