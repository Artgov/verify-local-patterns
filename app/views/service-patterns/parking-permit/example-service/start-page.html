  <h1 class="heading-xlarge">Apply for a resident's parking permit in Argleton</h1>

  <p>
    To park in Argleton City centre, you'll need a resident's parking permit. This will allow you to park anywhere within the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2009/nov/03/google">boundaries of the city</a>.
  </p>
  <p>
    Resident's permits cost Â£60 each. Each resident is allowed one permit.
  </p>
  <p>
    To apply, you'll need to prove that you live in Argleton using GOV.UK Verify, and provide your V5 certificate to prove that you are the registered keeper of the vehicle you want a permit for.
  </p>
  <p>
    The process of applying online takes about 10 minutes if you've never used GOV.UK Verify before. If you have, it should take about 5 minutes.
