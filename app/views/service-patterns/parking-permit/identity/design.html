			GOV.UK Verify will send your service the user\'s address, as supplied by the user\'s chosen identity provider. When the user returns from the GOV.UK Verify process, your service webpage should ask them to confirm if this is their current address. This
			is mainly done because GOV.UK Verify identity providers may not have the user\'s address if they moved house in the last 3 months.
		</p>
		<p>
			This page also tells the user their bus pass will be sent to the address received through GOV.UK Verify.
