      <h2 class="heading-medium">What we learnt</h2>
      <p>
        When users are confirming the correct details provided by Verify, no issues were observed.
      </p>
      <p>
       For users who had recently moved house, the verified address shown was not their latest address. All of those we spoke to identified this issue, however they assumed that this was the result of a system error, reducing confidence in the service.
      </p>
      <p>Most users were unhappy at having to rekey their latest address. The absence of a postcode lookup at this point worsened this effect.</p>
      <p>Users who have recently moved house are likely to return from Verify with their most recent address unverified. In this case, they should be a three month permit.</p>
      <p>Though we found that users understood the reason for this, some felt that this contradicted earlier messages that Verify had confirmed their identity.</p>

      <h2 class="heading-medium">What we changed</h2>
      <p>Changes have been made for users whose latest address is unverified to explain the issue is due to issues with identity verification, and is not the result of eligibility criteria applied by their local authority.</p>
      <p>Further work will be conducted during beta to refine the messaging and provide clarity at this point.</p>
