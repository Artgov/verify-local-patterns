      <h2 class="heading-medium">What we learnt</h2>
      <p>
        When deciding which permit to choose, most discussed price and convenience as the main factors in their choice.
      </p>
      <p>
        Most users expected that there would be a discount available for choosing a longer permit, and some expressed disatisfaction that this was not the case.
      </p>
      <h2 class="heading-medium">What we changed</h2>
      <p>
        Prices of permits were removed from this page. Though this has had the impact of reducing the number of users discussing price during testing, it is not clear that this has addressed the underlying issue.
