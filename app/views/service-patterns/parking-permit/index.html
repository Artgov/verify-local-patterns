                    Residents need a place to park their car near their home. Parking permit services make sure there are parking spaces available for residents. They make it illegal to park in some areas without a permit.

                            When the user knows they need a permit, they need to get to the right council's website to apply. Users might start by typing 'parking permit' into a search engine, or going to the website of the council where they think they need a permit.

                            Users may also go straight to the website for the council they think they need to get a permit from. This makes it very important for your service's webpage to clearly state which area your parking permit service covers – as the user may be in the wrong place.

                          Some councils require the permit to be associated with a specific vehicle.

                        <p>
                          In some councils, the permit price varies depending on the vehicle type, emissions, make or other conditions.

                        <p>
                          If your council requires this information, your service can look it up using DVLA's vehicle details API. In this case, the service should explain to users that their registration number will be used for this purpose as well.

                        <p>Some councils require users to provide either their V5C number, or a scan or the V5C form. If your council requires this information the service should explain to users why this information is required and how it will be used.</p>

                    It's better for users and cheaper for government if permits are issued electronically. Wardens check electronic permits by entering registration numbers into a handheld device linked to a database.
