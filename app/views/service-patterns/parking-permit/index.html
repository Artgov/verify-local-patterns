                    This page is for people who work in local authorities. It outlines a common pattern used for delivering resident's parking permits services effectively.

                <h2 class="heading-medium" id="user-need">What is the user need?</h2>
                <p>
                    Residents need a place to park their car near their home. Parking permit services make sure that parking spaces are only occupied by residents by making it illegal to park in a given area without a permit.
                </p>
                <p>We recommend that local authorities provide the parking permit service using a user centric approach.</p>

                <h2 class="heading-medium" id="council-need">What do councils need from users to deliver the service?</h2>
                <p>Depending on local authority needs, the user may be asked to provide a combination of:</p>
                <ul class="list list-bullet">
                    <li>
                        proof that the user lives in the area
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        the registration number of the vehicle to be permitted
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        payment (this is to support the cost of the service and will vary across councils and potentially within service, depending on the type of vehicle, engine size, parking zone and others)
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <h2 class="heading-medium" id="user-journey">What is the user journey?</h2>
                <p>
                    At a high level, these are the steps users should need to go through.

                            Users need to find out about the parking permits service before they need to park their car. There are a number of ways users could find out about the service, for example:

                        <ul class="list list-bullet">
                            <li>
                                information from the council when they sign up for council tax
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                information from their estate agent when they buy their house
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                signage in the street
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>
                            Local authorities should make sure the correct information is being provided through all channels within their control.

                    </li>

                        <h3 class="heading-small">Finding the right council</h3>
                        <p>
                            Once the user has found out they need a permit, they need to get to the right council's website to apply. Users might start by typing 'parking permit' into a search engine, or they might start on the council's website where they think they need a
                            permit.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            <a href="https://www.gov.uk/parking-permit">The parking permits page on GOV.UK</a>
                            should send them to the right council's website once they enter their postcode. Councils should make sure the postcodes that they serve are linked to the right page on their website and email any corrections to
                            <a href="mailto:local-direct-admin@digital.cabinet-office.gov.uk">local-direct-admin@digital.cabinet-office.gov.uk</a>.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Users may also go straight to the website for the council that they think they need to get a permit from. This makes it very important that councils clearly state which area their parking permit service covers as the user may be in the wrong place.
                            Read the next section for details on this.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Now the user is in the right place, the page on the council's website should communicate:
                        </p>
                        <ul class="list list-bullet">

                            <li>
                                a postcode look up tool to check eligibility for available permits based on selected address (if deemed necessary by the council due to the complexity of available permits)

                            <li>

                            GOV.UK Verify will send the council the user's address, as known by the user's chosen identity provider. On returning from the GOV.UK Verify process, the council should ask the user to confirm whether or not this is their current address.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            At this point the council should check whether or not the person or the household already has a parking permit. For some councils this may affect the price, for others it might mean the user can not have another permit.

                            If the user says the address returned is not correct, they are likely to be a new resident whose address has not been updated with their identity provider. The user should then be asked to enter their current address and warned that they must not
                            enter false information.

                        <p>
                            If the permit is physical, councils will get extra confidence in the address by mailing the permit to the address given. Councils should mention they'll be using the address for this purpose on the confirmation page.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            If the permit is digital and councils want extra confidence of eligibility, they can issue a temporary permit for a shorter time period, for example 3 months. After this time, the user's identity provider should have the new address and the user can
                            reapply.
                        </p>

                                    At this point the council should check whether or the user lives in the eligible area, and then show a message to the user confirming they are eligible. This is done by checking the user's address against a council held database of parking permit
                                    zones.

                                    Some councils have limits on the number of people who can get a permit, or number of permits allowed per address. At the same time as check addresss eligibility (from the point of view of the user), the council should check whether or not there are
                                    any permits currently assigned to the person or their address and issue an ineligible message if applicable.

                        <p>
                            After payment, the user needs to receive a confirmation of payment and an acknowledgement that their application has been successful. They should also receive information about how the permit will be enforced (See step 8). If the payment cannot be
                            accepted or if the application fails for some reason (i.e. times out) the user should be shown an on-screen message that specifies the next steps a user should take to continue with the application.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            The service should ask the user how they would like to receive this confirmation of payment, offering the choice of email, letter or text.

                        <p>
                            In the future, councils will be able to send this confirmation using

                        <p>
                            You may want to capture users contact details so they can be contacted if things go wrong with their application, or for use in future for renewal reminders.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            You should allow users to select their prefered contact method and only contact them in this way in future.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            It's better for users and cheaper for government if the permits are issued electronically. Wardens check the permits by entering number plates into a database.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Councils who haven't yet moved over to an electronic permit system, should have a plan in place to move over.
                        </p>

                        <p>In the meantime, councils should mention in the payment receipt
                        </p>

                            <li>
                                how long they will need to wait for a permit to be posted to them
                            </li>
                            <li>if they can pick up their permit from a council office to get it faster and where from</li>

                                if they can print a temporary permit themselves while they wait for a permanent one
                            </li>
                            <li>this information should also be communicated on the council's start page at the beginning of the user journey</li>
                            <li>advice on how customers can park without their permit until they receive it</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>
                            This information should also be communicated on the council's start page at the beginning of the user journey.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Temporary permits should clearly show their expiry date so wardens and users can check them easily.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Councils should remind users when it's time for them to renew their permits. They should do this using the same contact method as used in the payment receipt.
