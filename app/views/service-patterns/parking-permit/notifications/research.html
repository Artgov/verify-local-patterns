<h3 class="heading-medium">User needs identified during the Discovery phase</h3>
<p>
  As a resident applying for a pass, I need:
</p>
<ul class="list list-bullet">
  <li>to know what’s happening with my application, so that I know if something’s going wrong</li>
  <li>to know what went wrong, so that I can complete my application</li>
  <li>to know how and where I can use my permit</li>
</ul>
<p>
  Once applications had been submitted users needed to know that they were being processed, as well as when they would be issued. This can be a difficult time if the user has to make alternative parking arrangements whilst waiting for their permit.
</p>
<p>
  Some users contacted their council to find out what had happened to their application, as it was not clear to them at this point.
</p>
<p>
  As a resident renewing a permit, I need:
</p>
<ul class="list list-bullet">
  <li>to know when my permit expires, so that I know I need a replacement</li>
  <li>you to remember who I am, so that I don’t have to apply again every year</li>
  </ul>
<p>
  Some users were concerned they would forget their renewal, so wanted to be reminded when the date was due. In most cases, when it came to renewing, users were disappointed to have to complete another full application, as they thought their information would have been saved.
</p>
<h3 class="heading-medium">User needs observed while testing and iterating</h3>
<h4 class="heading-small">What we learnt</h4>
<p>
In early iterations, users were able to choose to opt out whether of they would receive notifications from the service. Although none opted out of these notifications on purpose, some did so accidentally.
</p>
<p>
Early iterations also only allowed users to select a single contact type, yet some users wanted to select more than one.
</p>
<p>
Some expressed disappointment at having to re-enter their phone number or email address.
</p>
<h4 class="heading-small">What we changed</h4>
<p>
Changes were made to allow users to select multiple contact types and to ensure that contact details that have already been entered are displayed.
Where possible, these pages should be pre-populated with contact details entered earlier in the transaction to reduce the need for re-entering personal data.
