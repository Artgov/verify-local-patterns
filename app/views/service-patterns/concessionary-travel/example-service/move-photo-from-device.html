            <p>
              A transfer cable is a lead which can connect your device to your computer. When it's connected, your computer will start transferring your photos to your computer.
            </p>
            <p>
              Insert one end of the cable into your device and the other into your computer to begin the transfer.

            <h3 class="heading-medium">Wifi or bluetooth</h3>
            <p>
              If your device has wifi or bluetooth functionality, it should have a wifi or bluetooth icon. If your computer also has wifi or bluetooth you can move your photos from your device to your computer without physically connecting the 2 devices.
            </p>
            <p>
              Look at your device instructions to find out how wifi and bluetooth work for your device.
