      <h2 class="heading-medium">What we learnt</h2>
      <p>In early iterations, users were able to choose whether they would recieve notifications from the service. Altough none opted out of these notifications on purpose, some did so accidentally.</p>
        
      <p>Early iterations also only allowed users to select a single contact type, yet some users wanted to select more than one.</p>
      <p>Some expressed dissapointment at having to re-enter their phone enumber or email address.</p>
      <h2 class="heading-medium">What we changed</h2>
      <p>Changes were made to allow users to select multiple contact types and to ensure that contact details that have already been entered are displayed.</p>
      <p>Where possible, these pages should be pre-populated with contact details entered earlier in the transaction to reduce the need for re-entering personal data.</p>
