				If the user selects the GOV.UK Verify route, they will be sent away from the council\'s website to prove their identity to a certified company. Before the user does this, the council should make sure the user understands what personal data will be

			<h3 class="heading-small">"Unlikely to verify" and "verification failed" pages</h3>

			<p>Some users may not have the documents or credit records that GOV.UK Verify needs to prove their identity.
			</p>

			<p>GOV.UK Verify asks users questions to work out if they are likely to be verified. If it looks like they won\'t be verified, they are shown the "<a href="https://pirate:bunting@govuk-verify.herokuapp.com/unlikely-to-verify?requestId={{serviceString}}-{{council.string}}&selection=true&above_age_threshold=false&resident_last_12_months=false&not_resident_reason=NoAddress">unlikely to verify</a>" page.
			</p>
			<p>
				A very small proportion of users will go through past these questions, and GOV.UK Verify will still not be able to verify their identity. These users will be told by their chosen Identity Provider that they couldn\'t be verified, and then be taken
				back to GOV.UK, where they will see a similar "<a
					href="https://pirate:bunting@govuk-verify.herokuapp.com/fail?requestId={{serviceString}}-{{council.string}}&serviceLOA=2&verify=false&security1=&security2=&firstName=&middleName=&lastName=&prevFirstName=&prevMiddleName=&prevLastName=&dob-day=&dob-month=&dob-year=&idp=experian&userLOA=2">

			<h3 class="heading-small">Unsuccessful verification</h3>
			<p>
				If the user\'s date of birth is not correct, something has probably gone wrong in the verifying process. Your service needs to advise them to continue using a different channel.
			</p>
			<a href="concessionary-travel/example-service/incorrect-dob">Explore confirm date of birth example council page</a>
		</p>
		<h3 class="heading-small">Not egibile because of age</h3>
		<p>
			If the user confirms their date of birth, your service should check the user is old enough to be eligible. If the user is not eligible based on their date of birth your service webpage should tell them they are not currently eligible and supply the
			date when they will be eligible.
		</p>

			<a href="concessionary-travel/example-service/not-eligible-age">Explore the not eligible because of age example council page</a>
		</p>
		<h3 class="heading-small">Confirm address</h3>
		<p>
			GOV.UK Verify will send your service the user\'s address, as supplied by the user\'s chosen identity provider. When the user returns from the GOV.UK Verify process, your service webpage should ask them to confirm if this is their current address. (This
			is mainly done because GOV.UK Verify identity providers may not have the user\'s address if they moved house in the last 3 months.)
		</p>
		<p>
			On this page you can also ask the user to confirm if they want your service to send the bus pass to the address they\'ve received through GOV.UK Verify.
		</p>
		<h3 class="heading-small">New residents address confirmation</h3>
		<a href="concessionary-travel/example-service/confirm-address">Explore the confirm name and address example council page</a>
		<p>
			If the user says the address returned is not correct, they are likely to be a new resident whose address has not been updated with their identity provider. Your service should ask users to enter their current address and warn them not to enter false
			information, as this is a civic offence.
		</p>
		<p>
			If the travel pass is physical, your service will get extra confidence in the address by mailing the pass to the address the user provided. Mention that your service will be using the address they\'ve given for this purpose on the service confirmation
			page.
		</p>

		<a href="concessionary-travel/example-service/current-address">Explore the enter their current address example council page</a>

		<p>
			When the user has confirmed their address, your service should check that the address they\'ve given is in the area your council provides services for. If the address is not in the area, your service webpage should tell them they are not eligible in
			this area.
		</p>
		<p>
			<a href="concessionary-travel/example-service/not-eligible-address">Explore the not eligible because of address example council page</a>
		</p>
		<h3 class="heading-small">Checking for existing passes</h3>

		<p>
			At this point your service should check if the user already has a bus pass by searching its records.</p>
		<p>
			If they already have a pass, your service webpage should tell them they are not eligible to apply for a new one, but they can renew or replace a lost or stolen pass with the \'Renew or replace your bus pass\' service.</p>
		<p>
			Include a link to contact your service, in case the user believes there has been a mistake.</p>
