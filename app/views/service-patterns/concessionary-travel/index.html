      </h1>

      <p>
         This page is for people who work in local authorities. It outlines a common pattern used for delivering older person's concessionary travel services effectively. <a href="/">Read more about service patterns.</a>
      </p>

      <h2 class="heading-medium">What is the user need?</h2>
      <p>
        As people get older, they are more likely to not be fit to drive. They also often retire from work, so their income goes down. For both of these reasons, they are entitled to free public transport.
      </p>

      <h2 class="heading-medium">What do councils need from users to deliver the service?</h2>
      <ul class="list list-bullet">
        <li>
          proof that the user lives in the area
        </li>
        <li>
          a passport style photograph of the user to put on the pass
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2 class="heading-medium">What is the user journey?</h2>
      <p>
        At a high level, these are the steps users should need to go through.
      </p>
      <h3 class="heading-small">1. Awareness</h3>
      <p>
        Users need to find out about their entitlement to concessionary travel. They may find out in a variety of ways.
      </p>
      <ul class="list list-bullet">
        <li>
          a letter from the council when they are nearing the entitlement age
        </li>
        <li>
          signage on buses and bus stops, or trains and trains stations
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Local authorities should make sure the right information is being provided through these channels.
      </p>
      <h3 class="heading-small">2. Check you are the right age</h3>
      <p>
        Residents of England can get a bus pass for free travel when they reach the female State Pension age, whether they’re a man or a woman.
      </p>
      <p>
        Residents of London can travel free on buses, tubes and other transport when they’re 60, but only within London.
      </p>
      <p>
        Residents of Wales can get a bus pass when they reach 60.
      </p>
      <p>
        This means that users may need to check whether or not they are old enough for concessionary travel. <a href="https://www.gov.uk/state-pension-age/y/bus_pass">There's a page for this on GOV.UK.</a> Councils should link to this page on their service's start page. (See step 3.)
      </p>

      <h3 class="heading-small">3. Find the right council</h3>

      <p>
        Once the user has found out they can get a free travel pass, they need to get to the right council's website to apply. Users might start by typing 'older person bus pass' or a related term into a search engine, or they might start on their local council's website.
      </p>
      <p>
        <a href="https://www.gov.uk/apply-for-elderly-person-bus-pass">The older person's buss pass page on GOV.UK</a> should send them to the right council's website once they enter their postcode. Councils should make sure the postcodes that they serve are linked to the right page on their website and email any corrections to <a href="mailto:local-direct-admin@digital.cabinet-office.gov.uk">local-direct-admin@digital.cabinet-office.gov.uk</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        To make sure they are in the right place, councils should have a similar page which sends them to the right council's website if they are in the wrong place. Councils can provide this functionality easily by using <a href="#">the open source component for the 'bus pass postcode checker'.</a> (Source code link in progress)
      </p>
      <p>
        <a href="concessionary-travel/example-service/postcode-router">See the example council page providing routing to the correct council</a>
      </p>


      <h3 class="heading-small">4. Council start page</h3>
      <p>
        Now the user is in the right place, the page on the council's website should communicate:
      </p>
      <ul class="list list-bullet">
        <li>
          what the bus pass will allow it's holder to do
        </li>
        <li>
          how long the process of applying will take
        </li>
        <li>
          when they should expect to receive their bus pass once they've applied
        </li>
        <li>
          that they'll need to provide a passport style photograph
        </li>
        <li>
          that they'll need to login or signup using GOV.UK Verify
        </li>
      </ul>
      <a href="concessionary-travel/example-service/start-page">See the example council start page</a>

      <h3 class="heading-small">5. Prove your age and residency</h3>
      <p>
        Using GOV.UK Verify, the user can securely prove their identity, address and age.
      </p>
      <a href="http://govuk-verify.herokuapp.com/intro?requestId=apply-for-bus-pass-argleton">Step through the GOV.UK Verify journey prototype</a> (username is pirate / password is bunting)
      <p>
        When the user returns from the Verify process, the council should check that they live in the are the council serves and that they are old enough for a bus pass. They should then direct the user to a page confirming whether or not they are eligible. This page can also ask the user to confirm they want the council to send the bus pass to the address they've received through GOV.UK Verify.
      </p>
      <ul class="list list-bullet">
        <li>
          <a href="concessionary-travel/example-service/eligible">See the page telling the user they are eligible</a>
        </li>
        <li>
          <a href="#">See the page telling the user they are not eligible</a> (page in progress)
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h3 class="heading-small">6. Upload passport style photograph</h3>

      <p>
        Bus passes need to have a photograph of the person who owns them, so that they can't be used by anybody else. It's a bus drivers responsibility to check the photo matches the user.
      </p>
      <p>
        Users can upload a digital passport style photograph for use on the bus pass, but they may need to be instructed how. The council website should ask the user whether or not they need instructions, and then step them through the process if they do.
      </p>
      <p>
        <a href="#">Step through the example guide for how to take and upload a passport style photograph</a> (page in progress)
      </p>

      <h3 class="heading-small">7. Sending the bus pass to the user</h3>

      <p>
        Once the user has uploaded their photograph, the council should tell the user their application is complete and reiterate when they can expect to receive their bus pass and that they will be posting it to the address they previously confirmed.
      </p>
      <p>
        <a href="#">See the example page telling the user when they can expect to receive their pass</a> (page in progress)
      </p>

      <h3 class="heading-small">8. Use bus pass</h3>
      <p>
        Bus passes are a physical plastic card that users can use on any bus in England. They show it to the driver on the way onto the bus.
      </p>
      <p>
        In London, the pass is an Oyster card which the user scans on a reader.
      </p>

      <h3 class="heading-small">9. Renewals</h3>
      <p>
        To reduce the possibility of fraud, bus passes can have expiry dates. To minimise user's effort, these expiry dates should not be less than 5 years from the time of issue.
      </p>
      <p>
        Councils should send a notification letter to users' address when their bus pass is about to expire.
      </p>
      <p>
        <a href="#">See the example notification letter to remind users to renew their pass</a> (page in progress)
