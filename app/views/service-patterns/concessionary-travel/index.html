      </h1>

      <p>
         This page is for people who work in local authorities. It outlines a common pattern used for delivering older person's concessionary travel services effectively. <a href="/">Read more about service patterns.</a>
      </p>

      <h2 class="heading-medium">What is the user need?</h2>
      <p>
        As people get older, they are more likely to not be fit to drive. They also often retire from work, so their income goes down. For both of these reasons, they are entitled to free public transport.
      </p>

      <h2 class="heading-medium">What do councils need from users to deliver the service?</h2>
      <ul class="list list-bullet">
        <li>
          proof that the user lives in the area
        </li>
        <li>
          a passport style photograph of the user to put on the pass
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2 class="heading-medium">What is the user journey?</h2>
      <p>
        At a high level, these are the steps users should need to go through.
      </p>
      <h3 class="heading-small">1. Awareness</h3>
      <p>
        Users need to find out about their entitlement to concessionary travel. They may find out in a variety of ways.
      </p>
      <ul class="list list-bullet">
        <li>
          a letter from the council when they are nearing the entitlement age
        </li>
        <li>
          signage on buses and bus stops, or trains and trains stations
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Local authorities should make sure the right information is being provided through these channels.
      </p>
      <h3 class="heading-small">2. Check you are the right age</h3>
      <p>
        Residents of England can get a bus pass for free travel when they reach the female State Pension age, whether they’re a man or a woman.
      </p>
      <p>
        Residents of London can travel free on buses, tubes and other transport when they’re 60, but only within London.
      </p>
      <p>
        Residents of Wales can get a bus pass when they reach 60.
      </p>
      <p>
        This means that users may need to check whether or not they are old enough for concessionary travel. <a href="https://www.gov.uk/state-pension-age/y/bus_pass">There's a page for this on GOV.UK.</a> Councils should link to this page on their service's start page. (See step 3.)
      </p>

      <h3 class="heading-small">3. Find the right council</h3>

      <p>
        Once the user has found out they can get a free travel pass, they need to get to the right council's website to apply. Users might start by typing 'older person bus pass' or a related term into a search engine, or they might start on their local council's website.
      </p>
      <p>
        <a href="https://www.gov.uk/apply-for-elderly-person-bus-pass">The older person's buss pass page on GOV.UK</a> should send them to the right council's website once they enter their postcode. Councils should make sure the postcodes that they serve are linked to the right page on their website and email any corrections to <a href="mailto:local-direct-admin@digital.cabinet-office.gov.uk">local-direct-admin@digital.cabinet-office.gov.uk</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        To make sure they are in the right place, councils should have a similar page which sends them to the right council's website if they are in the wrong place. Councils can provide this functionality easily by using <a href="#">the open source component for the 'bus pass postcode checker'.</a> (Source code link in progress)
      </p>
