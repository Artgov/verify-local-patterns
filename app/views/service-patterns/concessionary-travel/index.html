                                    Users may also go straight to the website for the council that they think they need to get a travel pass from. This makes it very important that councils clearly state which area their concessionary travel service serves as the user may be in the

                        At this point the council should check whether or not they have a bus pass against their records. If they already have a pass, they should tell them they are not eligible to apply for a new one, but they can renew or replace a lost or stolen one with the 'Renew or replace your bus pass' service. The page should also include a link to contact the council if the user believes there has been a mistake.</p>

                            Bus passes need to have a photograph of the person who owns them, so that they can't be used by anybody else. It's a bus driver's responsibility to check the photo matches the user.

                            Users can upload a digital photograph of themselves for use on the bus pass. Uploading a photo can be a complicated task for users depending on their circumstances, so the council service should find the right route for them with a series of questions, illustrated in this flow chart:

                            Once the user has uploaded their photograph, the council should tell the user their application is complete and reiterate when they can expect to receive their bus pass and that they will be posting it to the address they previously confirmed.

                            Bus passes are a physical plastic card that users can use on any bus in England. They either have to show it to the driver or scan on a reader when they get onto the bus.
