    The government standard for identity verification is <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/introducing-govuk-verify/introducing-govuk-verify">GOV.UK Verify</a>. Using GOV.UK Verify, the user can securely prove their identity. The service can also recieve the user's address and date of birth from GOV.UK Verify.
  </p>
  <p>
    Councils should offer an alternative to GOV.UK Verify as the service is not yet available to all UK citizens. This alternative could be an offline service.

    <h3 class="heading-small">If a user fails to verify</h3>

    <p>GOV.UK Verify can not currently successfully verify the identity of 100% of the population. If a user does not get successfully verified, the council should provide another way for the user to access the digital service, possibly by the user
        scanning in documents to prove their address.</p>
    <p>
        The council should also tell the user about any non-digital ways of accessing the service, for example:
    </p>
    <ul class="list list-bullet">
        <li>
            A paper form to print, complete and return to the council</li>
        <li>A phone number to call to do the application over the phone</li>
        <li>A place (such as a council office or library) that the user can come and get help completing the application process</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
