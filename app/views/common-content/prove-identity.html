      We need to check you're eligible for {{ 'a parking permit' if serviceString == 'parking-permit' else 'a bus pass' }}, and make sure it's you completing this application.
  </p>
  <p>
      To do this, we'll use GOV.UK Verify â€“ the new, secure way to prove who you are online.

  <h2 class="heading-medium">What this involves</h2>
  </p>
        <ol class="list list-number">
          <li>We'll transfer you to GOV.UK Verify.
          </li>
          <li>
              You'll choose an independent, government-approved company to check your identity.
          </li>
          <li>
              You'll answer some security questions.
          </li>
          <li>
              You'll return to {{ council.name }} website to complete your application.
          </li>
          </ol>
      <h2 class="heading-medium">How long will it take?</h2>
      <p>
        Verifying yourself with GOV.UK Verify takes about 5 minutes, and finishing your {{ 'parking permit' if serviceString == 'parking-permit' else 'bus pass' }} application is around 2 minutes.

        {% if council.permitWait > 1 or serviceString == 'concessionary-travel' %}
        {% if serviceString == 'parking-permit' %}Permits{% else %}Bus passes{% endif %} usually take {{council.permitWait}} working days to arrive.
      </p>
        {% if council.tempPermit == "print" and serviceString == 'parking-permit' %}
      <p>
        You'll need to print a temporary permit to park straight away.
      </p>
        {% elif council.tempPermit == "write" and serviceString == 'parking-permit' %}
      <p>
        You'll need to print or write your own temporary permit to be able to park straight away.
